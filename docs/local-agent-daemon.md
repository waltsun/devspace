# Local agent daemon

Local agent execution is owned by an on-demand `devspace-agentd` process, not
by the MCP server and not by an individual CLI invocation. The daemon is an
internal implementation detail: the normal workflow remains:

```text
devspace agents run/continue/show/ls
          │
          ▼
    devspace-agentd
          │
          ├── LocalAgentManager
          ├── LocalAgentStore
          ├── LocalAgentRuntimePool
          └── provider runtimes
```

On non-Windows systems, the CLI starts the daemon automatically when an agent
command needs it. On Windows, `devspace serve` with subagents enabled reuses a
valid interactive host or starts an owned persistent child for that foreground
invocation; there is no login-autostart registration. The MCP server can use
the same local client when an MCP operation needs agent functionality.
The daemon is scoped to one DevSpace `stateDir`, so one SQLite store and one
runtime owner serve all clients using that configuration.

Communication uses a private Unix domain socket on Linux/macOS or a named pipe
on Windows. The endpoint is not exposed through the public MCP HTTP port.
Provider session identifiers and logical agent records are durable; live
provider runtimes are disposable and may be recreated after a daemon restart.
Expected subagent failures cross the daemon boundary as structured error codes,
not message-string conventions. Agent records in `error` state retain the safe
message plus `errorCode` and `errorRetryable` fields so callers can distinguish
provider cancellation, provider availability, workspace conflicts, daemon
timeouts, and similar recovery categories after a background turn completes.
Internal provider causes are kept out of the daemon payload and persisted JSON.

The implementation treats `better-result` as the application-failure boundary,
not as a replacement for every exception. Expected target, scope, provider,
store, and daemon failures return typed Results. Sequential fallible setup uses
`Result.gen` when it makes the success path clearer, small Result-to-Result
transformations use `map`/`andThen`, and error policy at serialization or IPC
boundaries uses exhaustive tagged-error matching. Programmer defects and broken
invariants remain exceptions; cleanup and shutdown also stay best-effort so a
secondary release failure cannot replace the primary agent failure.

The daemon state directory contains the socket or pipe identity, an atomic
lock, a PID marker, and diagnostic logs. A second client cannot start another
daemon for the same state directory. Stale lock and socket files are recovered
only after the recorded PID is no longer alive.

The daemon is started on demand and may exit after its active turns, clients,
and warm runtime idle periods have ended. Users do not need to manage it during
normal operation. Diagnostic commands are available for startup, process, and
cleanup problems:

```bash
devspace agents daemon status
devspace agents daemon stop
devspace agents daemon logs
```

Agent commands accept `--json` when a machine-readable response is needed.
They emit one compact JSON value. `run` and `continue` return only the logical
agent ID and status, `ls` returns session summaries, and `show` returns the
response or structured failure for one agent. Internal workspace paths,
provider session IDs, timestamps, and prior responses are not included in list
or receipt output. Immediate failures are emitted as
`{ error: { code, message, retryable, ... } }` with a non-zero exit code.
Successful `daemon status` and `daemon stop` output the daemon status object,
and successful `daemon logs` output is `{ "logs": "<text>" }`.

Agent identity is explicit at the client boundary. `agents run` starts a new
logical agent from a profile or provider; `agents continue <id>` continues an
existing logical agent. Provider session IDs are never accepted as logical
agent IDs, and the daemon does not resolve ambiguous prefixes.

Shutdown gives active turns a bounded graceful window. If that window expires,
the process exits with active records left durable; the next daemon startup
reconciles stale `starting` and `running` records to `error` without discarding
their `providerSessionId` or `latestResponse`.
