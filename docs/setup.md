# Setup Guide

This guide covers ChatGPT and Coding Agents using DevSpace with local projects.

## Requirements

- Node `>=22.19 <27`
- npm
- Git
- Bash, including Git Bash or WSL on Windows
- a public HTTPS URL that forwards to the local DevSpace server when using manual
  tunnel mode and ChatGPT will connect

DevSpace can start `cloudflared`, `ngrok`, or `localtunnel` for the duration of
`devspace serve`. Manual mode supports Pinggy, Tailscale Funnel, or your own
HTTPS reverse proxy.

## Install And Configure

Run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init
```

The setup flow asks one question at a time.

First choose where you will use DevSpace: ChatGPT, Coding Agents, or both.
DevSpace uses that answer to skip setup that does not apply to you.

### Project roots

If you selected ChatGPT, choose the project folders it may open through
DevSpace. Keep this narrow.

Examples:

```text
~/personal,~/work
```

```text
/Users/alice/dev,/Users/alice/work
```

```text
C:\Users\alice\dev,C:\Users\alice\work
```

A Coding Agents-only setup skips this question. Direct `devspace agents`
commands use the current Git project, or the current directory outside a
repository, with the authority of your local shell. MCP workspace operations
remain limited to the roots configured for ChatGPT.

### Coding Agents

Setup detects supported Coding Agents and asks which ones DevSpace may use.
These choices are stored as provider objects under `subagents` in
`~/.devspace/config.json`.

If you selected Coding Agents, setup prints:

```bash
npx skills add Waishnav/devspace --skill subagents --global
```

The Skills CLI asks which installed Coding Agents should receive the skill.
The skill uses `devspace agents targets`, `run`, `continue`, `show`, and `ls`.
These commands do not require `devspace serve`.

### Connect ChatGPT

Setup only asks for a public URL if you selected ChatGPT and manual tunnel mode.
For a managed provider, `devspace serve` starts the tunnel and discovers its URL.
All providers forward to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676
```

In manual mode, enter the public origin without `/mcp`:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

With a managed provider, skip the public URL prompt; `devspace serve` prints
the discovered URL when it starts.

Configure the MCP client with the full MCP endpoint:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

A Coding Agents-only setup skips this section.

## Start The Server

Run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

To select a managed provider without editing JSON:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace config set tunnel.provider cloudflared
```

If your manual tunnel URL changes for one run, override it without rewriting config:

```bash
DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://new-tunnel.example.com" npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

For a stable public URL, persist it:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace config set publicBaseUrl https://devspace.example.com
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

## Approve The Client

When ChatGPT, Claude, or another MCP client connects, DevSpace shows an Owner
password approval page. Enter the Owner password printed during setup.

The default config files are:

```text
~/.devspace/config.json
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

Keep `auth.json` private.

## Check Your Setup

Run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace doctor
```

The doctor command reports the resolved config, Node version, Node ABI, platform,
Git, Bash, public URL, allowed hosts, and SQLite native dependency status.

## Running From A Local Checkout

If you are developing DevSpace itself instead of using the published package:

```bash
npm install --include=dev
npm run dev
```

The same setup rules apply.
